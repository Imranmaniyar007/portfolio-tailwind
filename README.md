# Tailwind CSS Portfolio Website âœ¨

This is a personal portfolio website built using **Tailwind CSS**. I created it during a **5-day intensive bootcamp** focused on mastering Tailwind CSS and UI design concepts.

## ðŸ’¡ What I Learned

During this bootcamp, I explored the power of Tailwind CSS â€” learning how utility-first CSS works, creating responsive layouts, experimenting with design components, and integrating animations and effects.

I particularly enjoyed:
- Discovering creative components on the official Tailwind CSS website
- Customizing and enhancing layouts
- Exploring UI addons and design patterns
- Balancing college commitments while building this project

## ðŸŒ— Features

- A clean, responsive personal portfolio layout
- Modern Tailwind-based styling
- Attempted to implement a **dark/light mode toggle** (still a work-in-progress)

## ðŸ™Œ My Experience

I absolutely loved creating this website. The bootcamp sessions were fun, informative, and interactive. I spent extra time researching cool addons, improving UI design, and enhancing my portfolio step-by-step. Although I couldnâ€™t fully implement dark/light theme toggling yet, I learned a lot and look forward to improving it soon!
